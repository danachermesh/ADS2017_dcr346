### This study is a course wide project in Applied Data Science class, Fall 2017, NYU CUSP

This research seeks to explore the relationship between school quality and crime in New York City. The goal is to better understand if crimes near schools negatively impact school performance or if low quality schools result in areas with higher levels of crime. To do this, data will be used from 2007 and 2013, as well as the changes between those years, to additionally assess how areas may have changed over time. Our hypothesis is that crime near schools negatively impacts school performance, particularly when looking at certain categories of crimes, such as drug-related offenses. 

For different phases and goals of the research two different geography units were analyzed: _**PUMA level**_ and _**Census tract level**_. Ipython notebook of each of these are in this repo.
